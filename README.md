# Illinois Unemployment Data Analysis

This project explores how unemployment rates have changed across metropolitan areas in Illinois from 1990 to 2025.

Rather than focusing on a single statewide trend, the analysis examines whether different cities move together over time, or whether some metropolitan areas consistently experience better or worse labor market conditions than others.

The goal is not to predict unemployment, but to understand which patterns are structural and which conclusions require caution.
